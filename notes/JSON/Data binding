JSON Data binding is the act of conversion from JSON to Java POJO and viceversa.
It is also known as serialization/deserialization, marshalling/unmarshalling, and mapping.

Jackson Project:
similar to Spring (which uses it behind the scenes for data binding).
It is used for mapping between POJOs and various formats (XML, JSON...)
It automatically calls the necessary setters (JSON to POJO) and getters (POJO to JSON) for the conversion.

When you create a REST controller, the data binding is done automatically behind the scenes!
A JSON is returned from your controller to the client, and any JSONs sent by the client are turned into POJOs.
This is thanks to the integration between Spring and Jackson.
