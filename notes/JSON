JavaScript Object Notation

File format which can be used with any programming language.
It consists of data organized in name-value pairs, each separated from the next by a comma;
the names are always wrapped in double quote signs, and the same goes for the values, except
when in presence of some value types (numbers, booleans, null...).
A colon is interposed between each name and its respective value.
The list of name-value pairs is delimited by curly braces.

Nested objects are delimited by an inner set of curly braces.
Arrays are delimited by square braces.

This notation can be used with any programming language.
