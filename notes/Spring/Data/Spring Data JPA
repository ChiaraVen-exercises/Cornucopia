The JpaRepository extends the CrudRepository, offering some additional functionalities related to pagination and
sorting.

If you request all elements of a given entity from a controller (example: "get all employees") while using
JpaRepository, the response will contain only some of the elements: ordinarily, the first 20, as a default setting.

In order to receive another batch of elements (example, the next 20), you need to use the page as a query parameter in
the url:

https://localhost:8080/my-wondrous-app/plonts -> first 20 elements
https://localhost:8080/my-wondrous-app/plonts?page=0 -> same as above
https://localhost:8080/my-wondrous-app/plonts?page=1 -> next 20 elements

In order to change this, if you use the JpaRepository in combination with Data REST, you can use the following
properties to override the defaults:

spring.data.rest.default-page-size
spring.data.rest.max-page-size

Spring Data REST's sorting functionalities are very useful!
If you wish to sort a list of elements in a response, simply specify the criteria in the url. Example:

https://localhost:8080/cornucopia/ingredients?sort=name,desc
