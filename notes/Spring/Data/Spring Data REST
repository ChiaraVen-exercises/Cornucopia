Spring Data REST and its power in vanquishing the need for boilerplate code!

Spring Data REST is a dependency you can add to your POM or Gradle build file.
It allows you to skip the creation of controller and service classes, by exposing default endpoints
for CRUD methods of any repository in your project (they have to implement the JpaRepository or the
CrudRepository interface).

You can extend its functionalities with different endpoints by still keeping service and controller classes,
which can be wholly dedicated to the custom endpoints.
If I understood correctly, the controller with the same default address as the default controller is distinct from it;
for example, in Cornucopia, I have an IngredientController with some custom methods, which only APPEARS to be an
extension of the default IngredientController since they share the same mapping.

The provided default endpoints follow certain conventions on the matter of name and method:
