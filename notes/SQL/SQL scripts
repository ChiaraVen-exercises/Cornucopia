SQL scripts are very useful in production since they offer many possibilities for fine-tuning,
and offer a much safer alternative than the customization provided, for example, by
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl properties (for example, if you set ddl-auto as "create" and you start your
application, you end up deleting all your production DB data!)
They are also useful for code review, and they can work well with schema migration tools like
Liquibase and Flyway.
