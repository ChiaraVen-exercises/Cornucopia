A path variable is a parameter contained inside an incoming request from the client
(in the cases I encountered, it is included inside the path of the endpoint to which the request is sent).

PathVariable is used inside controller endpoints to bind a path variable passed by the client to a parameter
used in a method of the app.

For an example of its usage, see "ingredient" in WelcomeController, and its path variable/parameter "id".

Note: in order for the annotation to work, the path variable inside the @GetMapping address and the
parameter used in the internal method have to share the same name.
