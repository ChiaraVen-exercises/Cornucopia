DAO = Data Access Object, used by the app to connect to the database.
Specifically, the Entity Manager (which has to be injected inside the DAOimpls) manages the DAOs.
(Remember: Entity Managers and Data Sources are automatically generated by Spring Boot thanks to
the related configuration provided in the application.properties (or application.yaml) and in the pom).
The Entity Manager connects to the correct database thanks to the info provided by the Data Source.

The DAO have to use the annotation @Repository in order to work.

Question: difference between DAOimpl class and Repository class?
Can they be considered the same thing?

- the DAOimpl extends an interface
- to my knowledge, you don't need to inject the Entity Manager inside a Repository class
    (maybe, this happens if they extend the CrudRepository interface?
