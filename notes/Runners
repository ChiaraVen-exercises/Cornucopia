CommandLineRunner is a functional interface, that is to say an interface containing a single method to implement.
Classes which implement CommandLineRunner can run snippets of code in their 'run' method, after
all the Spring Boot beans have been loaded; many Runner classes can be created, and the order of
their invocation can be decided with the @Order annotation.
Runners are very useful for executing code before the app accepts traffic.
