CommandLineRunner is a functional interface, that is to say an interface containing a single method to implement.
Classes which implement CommandLineRunner can run snippets of code in their 'run' method, after
all the Spring Boot beans have been loaded; many Runner classes can be created, and the order of
their invocation can be decided with the @Order annotation.
Runners are very useful for executing code before the app accepts traffic.

If the code inserted inside the runner does not get executed (for example, if it throws an exception,
as in the case of a failed update to a database object), the application does not start.
