In your controllers, it is considered good practice to use the plural of the related entity as request mapping
(example: IngredientController -> ingredients).
The endpoints should not contain the verb related to their function in their name (example, "ingredients/delete");
they should be differentiated by the HTTP method used, as much as possible.

Example:

delete ingredient:
endpoint with @DeleteMapping and name "ingredient/{id}"

save ingredient
endpoint with @PutMapping* or @PostMapping*, and same name as the endpoint above

* The PUT method should be used if you already know the URL which will be assigned to the resource you are creating,
and used for its retrieval or updating.
For example, you could use a PUT if you need to save details about a flight, and the primary key (the flight code) is
provided along with the object (the first in the URL, the second in the save request body).
In the case of Cornucopia, I prefer using a POST for the save endpoint, because I do not know the primary key of the
entity before it is saved.
