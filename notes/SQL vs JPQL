Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) is very similar to the Structured Query Language (SQL),
but has some crucial differences:
for example, the queries are not made with the name of the tables and columns, but with their
counterparts in the app (aka entity class names and field names).

Example of how to write a custom query for a DAOImpl (in case you prefer using that over the
Repository / Service pattern):


fun findAllIngredients () {
    var findAllIngredientsQuery : TypedQuery<Ingredient> =
        entityManager.createQuery("FROM Ingredient", Ingredient.class)

    return findAllIngredientQuery.getResultList()
}
