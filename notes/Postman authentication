While using Spring Security, you have to authenticate in order to receive successful responses from your app endpoints.
To do so on Postman, you have to configure your authentication info:

- inside your request, select the tab "Authorization"
- select the type "Basic Auth"
- insert the username and password you have configured for your app (see the spring.security properties in
  your properties file)
