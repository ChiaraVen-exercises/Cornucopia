An HTTP Request is composed by three main parts:

- Request line
    contains the HTTP command or method (GET, POST...)

- Header variables
    metadata (additional information) about this request

- Body of the message
    payload! Often in JSON



Similarly, an HTTP Response is made of three parts:

- Response line
    contains server protocol (version of HTTP protocol used?) and status code (500, 400...)

- Header variables

- Message body
