MIME = Multipurpose Internet Mail-Extension

MIME types represent the formats which a message returned from a server can assume.

The client uses the MIME type to understand how to render the info received from the server.

MIME types are written following the convention of type/subtype.

Examples:

- text/html
- text/plain
- application/json
- application/xml

all of these can be used with RESTful services.
